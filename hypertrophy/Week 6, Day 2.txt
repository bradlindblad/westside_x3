Repetition Lower (Starting with Stiff Leg Deadlift)
Week 6—Day 2 of the Westside Barbell Conjugate Hypertrophy Program
Stiff Leg Deadlift
Perform one set of 15 to 25 repetitions. Use full range and a smooth tempo.
Aim to beat your repetition record each week. Once you exceed 25 repetitions, increase the resistance of the band.
Stiff Leg Deadlift—Slow Eccentric
Perform 2 sets with a 5-second negative to failure using a lighter resistance band.
Once full repetitions break down, continue with partial repetitions until failure.
Split Squat
Complete 3 sets of 10–12 repetitions for each leg. Rest for 90–120 seconds, with no rest between sides.
Zercher March
Complete 3 rounds of 1-minute continuous marching. Choose music that challenges your posture while allowing you to move rhythmically.
Zercher “Ab” Rotations
Complete 2 sets of 20 repetitions per side. Control the rotation and ensure the band tension doesn’t disrupt your positioning.
