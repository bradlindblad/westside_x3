Repetition Upper (Starting with Reverse Grip Chest Press)
Week 3—Day 1 of the Westside Barbell Conjugate Hypertrophy Program
Reverse Grip Chest Press
Complete 1 set of 15 to 25 repetitions at a controlled pace—not too fast or too slow.
Choose a resistance band that challenges you while still permitting a full range of motion. Each week, aim to surpass your previous record for repetitions. Once you can perform 25 or more perfect reps, increase the resistance of your band.
Reverse Grip Chest Press—Slow Eccentric
Perform 2 sets to failure using a lighter resistance band, one level below your main set. Each repetition should include a 5-second negative phase.
If you're unable to complete a full range of motion (ROM) repetition, continue with partial reps until you reach total failure.
Rest for at least 3 minutes between sets.
Tricep Press
Perform 4 sets of 10 repetitions. The first 3 sets should be done with a full range of motion, without partial repetitions.
The final set should be taken to complete failure, incorporating partial repetitions at the end.
Underhand Grip Bent-Over Row
Perform 5 sets of 10 repetitions each. For sets 1 to 3, complete full-range repetitions with a 1-second pause at the top of each movement.
In set 4, do partial repetitions, stopping when you can no longer achieve 50% of the full range of motion.
For set 5, perform the exercise until you reach complete failure.
Lateral Raise
Perform 4 sets of 10 repetitions. Follow the same protocol as above: perform the first three sets with a full range of motion and a one-second pause at the top. The final set should include partial repetitions until failure.
Bicep Curl
Complete 4 sets of 10 repetitions, pausing for 1 second at the top of each rep. For the final set, finish with partial repetitions until failure.
