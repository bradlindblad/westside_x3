Repetition Lower (Starting with Front Squat)
Week 3—Day 2 of the Westside Barbell Conjugate Hypertrophy Program
Front Squat
Perform one set of 15 to 25 repetitions. Use a full range of motion with a smooth tempo. Aim to surpass your repetition record each week. Once you exceed 25 repetitions, increase the resistance of the band.
Front Squat—Slow Eccentric
Perform 2 sets with a 5-second negative to failure using a lighter band. Once full repetitions break down, continue with partial repetitions until failure.
Split Squat
Perform 3 sets of 10 to 12 repetitions per leg. Rest for 90 to 120 seconds. Do not rest between sets for each side.
Zercher March
Complete 3 rounds of continuous marching for 1 minute each. Choose a band that challenges your posture while allowing rhythmic movement.
Zercher “Ab” Rotations
Complete 2 sets of 20 repetitions on each side. Control the rotation to ensure the band tension doesn’t affect your positioning.
