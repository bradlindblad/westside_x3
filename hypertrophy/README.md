# Conjugate Hypertrophy Program
This 6-week program focuses on high-effort, high-tension training using repetition and dynamic effort days to build serious muscle mass. Developed in the Westside Barbell tradition, it’s the most hypertrophy-focused program in the Westside Barbell X3 Academy.


## About This Program
This is the most hypertrophy-focused program in the Westside Barbell X3 Academy. Over six weeks, you’ll train four days a week—two upper-body sessions and two lower-body sessions—cycling between repetition and dynamic effort days.

Unlike the other Westside Barbell programs, which are primarily focused on maximizing strength or athletic performance, this plan emphasizes time under tension, fatigue management, and intelligent overload. Expect precise protocols for eccentric loading, partial reps, and advanced volume manipulation.

These techniques are not just for getting a pump—they’re intended to promote real muscle growth. This program is built on Louie Simmons’ core principles for hypertrophy within the Conjugate Method and has been tailored specifically for the X3 system.

## Who's This Program For?
This program is perfect for lifters aiming to prioritize size—without losing sight of structure, discipline, or results. It’s meant for intermediate to advanced users already familiar with the X3 system and Westside principles.

If you’ve finished the Foundations Program and want to push deeper into hypertrophy with a structured plan, this is the next step.

You should have a solid understanding of the X3 system, including how to perform exercises with strict form and how to manage your effort levels. This program is not for beginners; it’s designed for those who are ready to commit to a serious hypertrophy-focused training regimen.

This is a 6-week training program focused on hypertrophy, emphasizing two main factors: tension and effort.

Our goal is not just to achieve a "pump"; you will be performing strict movements, applying strategic overload, and following an intelligent progression.

You will train four days a week, alternating between Repetition and Dynamic Effort Days for both upper-body and lower-body workouts. This follows the same 3-week cycles introduced by Louie Simmons to maximize hypertrophy.

Before starting each session, review the notes for each exercise. Each workout has specific guidelines, especially concerning partial reps, target repetitions, and rest periods.

Each workout will last 45–60 minutes if you stay focused. Bring intent.

Keep track of your repetitions and strive to exceed your previous numbers. This is how you achieve growth.
