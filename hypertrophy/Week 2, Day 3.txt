Chest Press—Speed Work
Complete 5 sets of 5 repetitions with 30 seconds of rest. Use a band that allows for quick presses while maintaining perfect form.

Complete 5 sets of 10 repetitions each. The first 3 sets consist of strict, full repetitions.
For set 4, perform partial repetitions until you reach 50% of the range of motion. Set 5 should be taken to complete failure using partial repetitions.

For set 4, include partial repetitions up to 50% of the range of motion.
For set 5, push to complete failure while incorporating partial repetitions.
