Week 4—Day 3 of the Westside Barbell Conjugate Hypertrophy Program
Overhead Press—Speed Work
Perform 5 sets of 5 repetitions with 30 seconds of rest. Use a band that allows you to press quickly with perfect form.
Close Grip Chest Press
Perform 5 sets of 10 repetitions. The first 3 sets are strict full repetitions. Set 4 includes partials only until a 50% range of motion is possible, while set 5 is taken to complete failure using partials.
Bent-Over Row
The setup remains the same as the pressing routine: perform 5 sets of 10 repetitions, incorporating a one-second pause at the top of the movement for the first 3 sets.
For the fourth set, include partial repetitions within a 50% range of motion, and for the fifth set, go to complete failure with partial repetitions.
French Press
Perform 4 sets of 1- repetitions. The first 3 sets should use full range of motion only; the final set includes failure with partial repetitions.
Reverse Grip Bicep Curl
Perform 4 sets of 10 repetitions, pausing for 1 second at the top of the first 3 sets. The final set includes partial repetitions to failure.
