Combo Dynamic Effort Day
Week 2 – Day 1 of the Westside Barbell Athletics Program
Introduction
The goal of this workout is to complete it as quickly as you can without sacrificing form.
In the first week, approach the pace with an “8/10 mentality” — your goal will be to beat your time each week for the following three weeks.
Start a timer at the first movement and let it run until your final set is complete.
1. Front Squat
Choose a band that allows you to complete 5 sets of 5 reps with only 30 seconds of rest.
Use the heaviest band you can handle while maintaining quick, controlled reps.
2. Squat Accessory Giant Set
Perform 3 sets of the following 3 exercise circuit in succession, with as little rest between as possible. (A circuit means you will complete 1 set of exercise A, B and C before moving to your second set of exercise A, etc.
a) Bodyweight Jump Squats
15 reps — aim to jump as high as possible each rep.
b) Zercher Split Squats
10 reps per leg — complete all reps on one side before switching.
c) Zercher Side Bends
10 reps per side, alternating sides until all reps are complete.
3. Chest Press
Same setup as squats — 5 sets of 5 reps, 30 seconds rest, using the heaviest band you can move quickly with.
4. Press Accessory Giant Set
3 rounds of the following 3 exercises with minimal rest between movements.
a) Muscle Clean and Press
10 reps
b) Bent Over Row
10 reps
c) Bodyweight Push Ups
AMRAP (as many reps as possible). Terminate the set if you need more than one breath at the top.
5. Conventional Deadlift
Same format — 5 sets of 5 reps with only 30 seconds of rest. Use a heavy band and move with speed.
6. Deadlift Accessory Giant Set
3 rounds of the following movements with as little rest as possible.
a) Stiff Leg Deadlift
10 reps
b) Shrug
15 reps
