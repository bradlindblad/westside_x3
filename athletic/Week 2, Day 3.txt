Heavy Upper Overhead Press
Heavy Upper Overhead Press
Week 2 – Day 3 of the Westside Barbell Athletics Program
Introduction
This upper body workout targets the shoulders, triceps, and upper back with a focus on overhead pressing. The session builds maximum strength through progressive loading and finishes with rest-pause sets to maximize hypertrophy.
1. Overhead Press (Max Effort)
Begin by gradually increasing band resistance to the heaviest band you can manage for 3–5 reps.
Once you achieve a personal best, work to improve it in future workouts.
When 5 reps are easy, move to a heavier band.
2. Overhead Press (Max Reps)
Drop down to a lower band tension (either from double to single, or down one level) and perform one max-rep set.
Log your reps — the goal is to beat this number the next time you do this workout.
3. Tricep Press
Perform 3–4 sets of 6–10 reps.
Advance band tension only after completing all 4 sets with 10 clean reps.
Rest 75–90 seconds between sets.
4. Bent Over Row - Reverse Grip (Rest-Pause)
Do one set to failure, rest for 10 deep breaths, and repeat for a total of 3 efforts.
Your goal is 15 total reps minimum; increase band tension once you exceed 25.
5. Lateral Raise (Rest-Pause)
Same format: 3 sets with 10-breath rests between them.
Start with a minimum goal of 20 total reps, and upgrade difficulty after 30+ reps.
6. Bicep Curl (Rest-Pause)
This finisher follows the same rest-pause protocol.
