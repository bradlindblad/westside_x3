Heavy Lower Zercher Squat
Heavy Lower Zercher Squat
Week 1 – Day 2 of the Westside Barbell Athletics Program
Introduction
This lower body workout emphasizes building raw strength in the quads, glutes, and core through Zercher squats, split squats, and targeted posterior chain work. Use progressive overload and precise rest strategies to optimize gains.
1. Zercher Squat (Max Effort)
Warm up gradually to the heaviest band you can handle for at least 3–5 reps.
Once you've hit a personal best, aim to improve it in future sessions.
When you're hitting 5+ reps consistently, increase the band tension.
2. Zercher Squat (Max Reps)
After the max-effort set, reduce band resistance (drop from double to single or decrease band level).
Perform one all-out set for maximum reps.
Track your reps and aim to improve each time this workout is repeated.
3. Split Squat
Perform 3 sets of 8–12 reps per leg.
Increase resistance when all 3 sets of 12 are completed with control.
Rest 75–90 seconds between sets with no rest between legs.
4. Stiff Leg Deadlift (Rest-Pause)
Execute one set to failure, then rest for 10 deep breaths.
Repeat twice more, using the same rest format.
Aim for at least 12 total reps; increase tension when you reach 20 across all three sets.
5. Zercher Oblique Twist
Complete 2 sets of 20 reps per side.
Only increase difficulty once you can complete both sets with perfect form.
Rest 75–90 seconds between sets.
6. Isometric Deadlift
Hold tension in 3 positions (low, mid, near-lockout) for 10 seconds each per set.
