Heavy Lower Front Squat
Heavy Lower Front Squat
Week 2 – Day 2 of the Westside Barbell Athletics Program
Introduction
This workout is focused on building lower body strength through progressive overload, targeting the front squat and supporting posterior chain movements. Your goal is to increase resistance over time while maintaining control and full range of motion.
1. Front Squat (Max Effort)
Slowly warm up to the heaviest band you can handle for a minimum of 3–5 reps.
Once you've established a personal best, aim to beat it every time this movement appears again.
When you can perform 5+ reps comfortably, increase the level of band resistance.
2. Front Squat (Max Reps)
After your max-effort set, drop band resistance slightly — from double to single, or down one level — and perform a single set for maximum repetitions.
Record your rep count and aim to beat it next time.
3. Split Squat
Perform 3 sets of 8–12 reps per leg.
Advance to a harder band only when you can perform all 3 sets of 12 comfortably.
Rest 75–90 seconds between sets, with no rest between legs.
4. Stiff Leg Deadlift (Rest-Pause)
Complete a set to failure, then rest for 10 deep breaths.
Repeat for a second and third set using the same pattern.
The minimum rep target across all 3 sets is 12.
Once you can achieve 20 reps total, move to a stronger band.
5. Zercher Oblique Twist
Perform 2 sets of 20 reps per side.
Increase resistance only when both sets are completed with control.
Rest 75–90 seconds between sets.
6. Isometric Deadlift
Perform 3 sets of 10 seconds in 3 positions:
Low position where band tension begins
Midpoint of the movement
Just before lockout
Rest for 30 seconds between each set.
