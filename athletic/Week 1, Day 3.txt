Heavy Upper Reverse Grip Chest Press
Heavy Upper Reverse Grip Chest Press
Week 1 – Day 3 of the Westside Barbell Athletics Program
Introduction
This upper body strength session focuses on pushing volume and intensity with the reverse grip chest press as the primary lift. You'll follow it up with direct arm, back, and shoulder work using rest-pause techniques to maximize effort.
1. Reverse Grip Chest Press (Max Effort)
Warm up to the heaviest band you can handle for 3–5 controlled reps.
Once you've set a personal best (PB), work toward beating it in future sessions.
When you're hitting 5+ reps comfortably, level up the band resistance.
2. Reverse Grip Chest Press (Max Reps)
After the max effort set, reduce band tension and perform one set for maximum reps.
Record the total reps — this becomes your benchmark for next time.
3. Tricep Press
Do 3–4 sets of 6–10 reps.
Only increase the difficulty once you're consistently hitting 10 reps across all sets.
Rest 75–90 seconds between sets.
4. Bent Over Row - Reverse Grip (Rest-Pause)
Perform a set to failure, rest for 10 deep breaths, and repeat for a total of 3 rounds.
Hit at least 15 reps across all rounds before moving to a more challenging band.
5. Lateral Raise (Rest-Pause)
Follow the same format: 3 rounds with short breath-based rests.
20 total reps minimum; push for 30+ before increasing resistance.
6. Bicep Curl (Rest-Pause)
Your final movement uses the same protocol.
