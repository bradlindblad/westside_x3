The Athletics Program is the training split currently used by the competitive athletes at Westside Barbell. This program is extremely effective for building strength, explosive power and increasing VO2 Max – while building muscle.

## About

This program comprises three training days: one for the upper body, one for the lower body, and one for the full body. Both the upper-body and lower-body sessions include a heavy day focused on strength building, as well as a dynamic whole-body day aimed at enhancing performance and explosive power.

This program is the foundation for athlete training plans currently utilized at Westside Barbell. It has proven effective in building muscle, increasing strength, and rapidly boosting VO2 max, making it the choice of many top athletes in the world today.

## Who's This Program For?

This program is ideal for all lifters, ranging from intermediate to advanced, who want to build muscle and attain world-class strength. We strongly recommend spending at least two months on the Westside Barbell X3 Foundations Program before transitioning to the Westside Barbell X3 Athletics Program.

## Implementing This Program

Welcome to the Athletics Development Program. This training schedule and structure is what our top athletes are currently using at Westside Barbell, which means one thing: it’s going to be intense!

This is a 3-day-per-week program, and the remaining 4 days are meant for sport-specific training, postural and plyometric work, general fitness, and last but not least, recovery.

At Westside, we train on the following days, which, in an ideal world, you would mimic. If these don’t work in your schedule, that’s fine; just ensure you’re trying to maintain the order and spacing of the workouts.

Tuesday: Combination DE Day
Thursday: Heavy Lower Body
Saturday: Heavy Upper Body
