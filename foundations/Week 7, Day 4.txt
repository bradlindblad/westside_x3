Dynamic Lower
Week 7 – Day 4 of the Westside Barbell Foundations Program
1. Front Squat
For this exercise you’re going to choose a relatively light band that you can squat with speed. Once you’re warmed up you’re going to do 9 sets of 3 squats with a 10 second rest in between each set. Once you’ve completed a set of 3 reps you will alternate between resting while squatting in the bottom of a squat (but not so low you lose tension) and the next rest period you will stand in the lock out squat position.
2. Deadlift
For deadlift you will again choose a relatively light band that you can deadlift with speed. You’re going to perform 9 sets of 3 with a 10 second rest in between each set. Once you’ve completed a set of 3 reps you rest holding the bar in the lock out position.
3. Zercher Squat March
For this exercise you will perform 2 sets of 60 second marches with 75-90 seconds of rest.
4. Split Squat
