This 8-week program is the classic Westside Barbell training split, designed to build both strength and muscle mass.

## About

This program is rooted in the classic 4-day Westside Barbell training split, which includes four training days: two dedicated to the upper body and two to the lower body. Each day includes a heavy session aimed at building strength and a dynamic session focused on enhancing performance and explosive power.

This combination, coupled with the hypertrophy work integrated into each day, forms the core of the Conjugate Methodology, allowing you to develop strength, explosive power, and significant muscle mass simultaneously. This program has underpinned Westside Barbell’s success with lifters and athletes for nearly four decades and continues to be utilized by some of the strongest lifters in the world.

## Who's This Program For?

This program is perfect for all lifters, from intermediate to advanced, who aspire to build muscle and achieve world-class strength. We recommend at least three months of standard X3 training before starting the Westside Foundation Program to ensure you have a solid foundation of strength and technique. This program is not for beginners, as it requires a high level of proficiency in the movements and a strong understanding of how to push your body to its limits.

## Implementing This Program

As you embark on this program, it is essential to recognize that it is designed to be challenging! During the first week, we suggest underestimating your abilities to ensure you master the movements and are prepared for the workload.

This program consists of four weekly workouts, each lasting no more than one hour.

Ideally, you should plan your workouts on the following days:

Monday: Heavy Upper Body
Wednesday: Heavy Lower Body
Friday: Dynamic Upper Body
Saturday: Dynamic Lower Body
We understand that this may not always be the case; if that’s the situation, please continue to follow the days in order and do your best to stick to the prescribed schedule as closely as possible to ensure the best recovery and progress.
