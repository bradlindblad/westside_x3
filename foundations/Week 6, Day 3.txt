Dynamic Upper
Week 6 – Day 3 of the Westside Barbell Foundations Program
1. Chest Press
For this exercise you’re going to choose a relatively light band that you can press with speed. Once you’re warmed up you’re going to do 9 sets of 3 chest presses with a 10 second rest in between each set. Once you’ve completed a set of 3 reps you will hold the bar at lockout during the rest period.
2. Overhead Press
For this exercise you will perform 3-4 sets of 6-10 reps, only moving to a more difficult level of resistance when you can comfortably perform all 4 sets of 10 reps. You should rest between 75-90 seconds between sets.
3. Bent Over Row
On this exercise you’re going to perform a Rest-Pause (RP) set. This means you will perform a set to failure, rest for 10 deep breaths and then perform another set to failure followed by 10 deep breaths and one more final set to failure. 15 reps across this entire RP exercise will be your minimum target and you will increase the level of band tension once you can complete 25 reps over the entire rest-pause set.
4. Skull Crusher (or X3 tricep extension)
This exercise will also be a rest-pause set, following the same protocol. Your minimum rep target is 20 reps and you will increase the difficulty once you’ve achieved more than 30.
5. Reverse Grip Curl
This is the final exercise of the workout and another rest-pause set. Your minimum reps are 20 and you will increase at the next workout when you’ve achieved at least 30 reps.
